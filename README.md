### Prop Anarchy

Prop Anarchy is a new project to extend the current prop framework in Cities Skylines, allowing for more than 65k props, and many more functionalities.

This mod is currently in alpha stage, and will break compatilibity with a lot of mods in workshop, thus time will be needed to try and update these incompatible mods, or to just include their functionality into this mod, for easier dependency management.
